# Project description:

The **Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES)** is one of the largest political surveys in the U.S. As I worked on this dataset in R recently, I wanted to explore more of this dataset in Python. This dataset is sourced from the Harvard dataverse.

## Context

The CCES is a 50,000+ person national stratified sample survey administered by YouGov.

## Content

This dataset contains the 2006 - 2020 respondents from the Common Content of the CCES (n = 531,755), combining all available Common Content datsets up to the 2020 preliminary release. It includes select standardized variables including demographics, geography, vote choice, validated vote, representative approval, the economy, etc.

## Analysis and Visualization
As we are learning about data visualization using python matplotlib and pandas libraries, using a large dataset such as CCES election survey would be a good challenge to explore various plotting methods and techniques. I have visualized my features of interest using Altair.

## Conclusion
I expect to see the host and guest data plotted using python libraries and find out interesting outliers if there are any.
